# U
## Introduction
U (Universal) is a series of projects that contains thousands of ideas.
U aims to create a completely new operating system that is able to run on any platform within a single respiratory. Similar to LibreOffice, U is coded using various languages, namely C, C++, C# Java, React.js, Bash, Powershell, Python, Mojo, Perl, SQL, and XML. A vast amount of files are expected.
U also aims to create a Hub for people to use the U library easily, so U will be able to be applicable on both Java and C.
U also allows people in [The-cooperation-plan](https://github.com/The-cooperation-plan) to use U as a hub to share their ideas, as well as to seek collaborators.
U will be actively linked with LinkedIn and Github Global Campus, allowing a higher chance for people to seek ideas and collaborators.

## U member structure
The structure of U is designed to give the maximum freedom for people joining U in this Github Respiratory.
The role of members is mainly divided into two different sections:
1. Recommandable - People are able to get their roles due to different interests, abilities, etc...
2. Admin - People are not able to get this type of role since this type of role keeps the entire project running.
There are three Admin roles:
   - Host (MCHIGM)
   - Operator (members in The-cooperation-plan)
   - Leader (chosen by the Host after being recommended by half of the Operators)
   The Recommendable roles are yet to be decided
